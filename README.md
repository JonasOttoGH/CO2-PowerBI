# CO2-PowerBI
A dashboard looking at C02 data from 1750 - 2022

A portfolio project looking at CO2 data using SQL and Power BI.

Project Limitations: Time to complete the project. I didn't quite manage to answer all the questions in the 'Ask' stage of the project. Details on further improvements have been written below.


Ask:
1: What is the total GHG/C02 responsibility (percentage) for each country?
2: Does GDP influence GHG /CO2?
3: What is the total yearly CO2 increase/decrease per country?
4: What is the amount of GHG/C02 per Capita?

Prepare:
The data used was a sample database downloaded from Ourworldindata.org (citation below):

Process:
Data that was needed for visualisation was extracted using Microsoft SQL Server (please refer to the script for more details)


Analyse/Share:
Finally, an interactive dashboard was made using Power BI.
Link to final product: 

Improvements/Changes needed (when time permits):
 - Make a visualise page for Greenhouse Gases
 - Focus on 'Ask' question: 2: Does GDP influence GHG /CO2?
 - Figure out how to continue to keep map Sphere at all times (will most likely need to use Photoshop for this)
 - Locate missing country data (blank)
 - Much more ( always learning =) )
